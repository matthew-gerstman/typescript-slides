Ten Steps Back: What is TypeScript?
---
Strict superset of JavaScript
---
It looks like this
Code Here
---
It's smart, really smart.
---
Example with a function that returns different things based on a string
---
It's theoretically, incremental, and opt in.

# yarn add @types/react
---
# The second you add React TypeScript is no longer incremental
---
# Why?
---
# Render Props
---
# HOCs
---
# Function Components
---
# Writing Tests
---
# You either need robust mock data, lots of anys, or you're going to be updating types a lot.
---
# We're bolting on types to an untyped language
---
# You're going to need to learn advanced TypeScript features faster than you realize
---
# All of this is still worth it.
---
# I wager that TypeScript always ends up being a better decision over time
Graph up and to the right, show a line where its more hassle than not
---
# Graph As your team scales
---
# Graph As your number of lines of code grows
---
# Graph As time goes on and you forget how something works
---
# Graph As your requirements change
---
# Graph Refactoring is trivial
